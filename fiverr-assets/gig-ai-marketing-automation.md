## FAQ

**Q: Do I need any technical knowledge?**
A: None at all. I deliver ready-to-use content you can copy and paste. If you want to learn the system, I offer optional training sessions.

**Q: What platforms do you support?**
A: Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Facebook, and Pinterest. I optimize content format and hashtags for each platform.

**Q: Can the AI really match my brand voice?**
A: Yes. I analyze your existing content, brand guidelines, and tone preferences, then train the AI to write exactly like your brand. Most clients can't tell the difference.

**Q: What if I don't like the content?**
A: Every package includes revision rounds (unlimited for Premium). I refine until you're satisfied.

**Q: What about the product images?**
A: I generate professional product photography using AI -- no studio, no photographer, no props needed. Just send me your product photos or descriptions and I create lifestyle shots, flat lays, and branded visuals.

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?**
A: ChatGPT gives you generic text. I build a complete system -- brand-trained AI captions, AI product photography, animated videos, hashtag research, scheduling strategy, and analytics tracking. It's a full marketing machine, not a chatbot.
