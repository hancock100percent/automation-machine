## Gig Description

Professional product images without the photoshoot. I create high-quality AI-generated visuals using Stable Diffusion XL -- the same technology used by top brands and agencies.

**What You Get:**

- Photorealistic product images (lifestyle, flat lay, or studio style)
- Social media visuals sized for every platform
- Consistent style across your entire image set
- Full commercial rights included
- Optional: animated product video clips from your images

**What Makes This Different From Generic AI Art:**

- I use professional multi-step workflows (base model + refiner + upscaling)
- Custom prompt engineering for YOUR specific product and brand
- Iterative refinement -- not one-shot generation
- Every image runs on dedicated GPU hardware (no cloud queues, no watermarks)

**Image Specs:**
- Resolution: 1024x1024 base (up to 2048x2048 with upscaling)
- Format: PNG (transparent backgrounds available) or JPG
- Styles: Photorealistic, editorial, minimalist, lifestyle, artistic, or custom

**Perfect For:**
- E-commerce product listings (Shopify, Amazon, Etsy)
- Social media content (Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok)
- Website hero images and blog visuals
- Marketing campaigns and ads
- Pitch decks and presentations

Message me your product or brand details and I'll send you a free sample concept.
