# CLF-C02 Exam Tips

## General Tips

- Read each question carefully -- look for keywords like "most cost-effective", "most secure", "least operational overhead"
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers first
- "AWS manages" vs "customer manages" questions are common -- know the Shared Responsibility Model cold
- When in doubt between two answers, pick the one that is more "AWS-native" (managed service over self-managed)
- Time management: ~80 seconds per question, flag difficult ones and come back

## Common Traps

- **"Free tier" vs "Always free"** -- some services have a 12-month free tier, others are always free (Lambda, DynamoDB within limits)
- **Regions vs Availability Zones vs Edge Locations** -- know the hierarchy
- **S3 storage classes** -- know when to use Standard, IA, Glacier, Deep Archive
- **Support plans** -- know what each tier offers (Basic, Developer, Business, Enterprise)
