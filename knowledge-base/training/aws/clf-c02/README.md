## Study Schedule

Follow the [4-week study schedule](notes/study-schedule.md) for a structured day-by-day plan (~1 hr/day weekdays, ~2 hrs/day weekends).

## Study Strategy

1. **Understand, don't memorize** -- CLF-C02 tests conceptual understanding
2. **Focus by weight** -- Domain 3 (34%) and Domain 2 (30%) are 64% of the exam
3. **Practice questions** -- Do all 80 practice questions, review explanations for wrong answers
4. **Use the knowledge pipeline** -- Ingest recommended videos/podcasts via `knowledge_ingest.py`
