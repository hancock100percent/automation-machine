**Query:** What is the current API pricing for Perplexity Pro API and Claude Sonnet 4 API in January 2026? I need exact costs per million tokens for input and output. Also clarify if Perplexity Pro subscription (/month) includes API usage or if API is billed separately.

**Response:**
**Perplexity does not offer a "Pro API"; its API uses models like Sonar Pro and Sonar Reasoning Pro, priced at $2–$3 per 1M input tokens and $8–$15 per 1M output tokens.** No search results mention a "Claude Sonnet 4 API," so its pricing cannot be confirmed from available data. Perplexity Pro subscription ($20/month) includes $5/month in API credits, but API usage beyond that is billed separately on a pay-as-you-go basis.[1][2][4][6][8]

## [2026-01-29] Claude Code Session - SadTalker Debugging

**Summary:** Attempted to run SadTalker talking head workflow on The Machine. Hit FFmpeg/TorchCodec error.

**Issue:** `ShowAudio` node (Node ID 6) in SadTalker workflow fails with `Could not load libtorchcodec`. PyTorch 2.9.1 uses torchcodec as default torchaudio backend, which requires FFmpeg shared DLLs on Windows. FFmpeg is not installed on The Machine.

**Fix options identified:**
1. Install FFmpeg full-shared build (winget or manual download) + add to PATH
2. Quick fix: `pip install soundfile` and change `torchaudio.load()` to use `backend="soundfile"`

**Status:** FIXED.

**What was done:**
1. SSH key auth set up (Gaming PC → The Machine, passwordless)
   - Added `Match Group administrators` + `administrators_authorized_keys` to sshd_config
   - Claude Code can now run remote commands on The Machine directly
2. Patched `ShowAudio.py` line 29: added `backend="soundfile"` to `torchaudio.load()`
3. Restarted ComfyUI service — confirmed running (v0.7.0, RTX 5060 Ti detected)

**Next steps (in order):**
1. ~~Download SadTalker models~~ DONE (same session)
2. ~~Test SadTalker with photo + audio~~ DONE (same session)
3. Evaluate quality of test output
4. If quality acceptable, proceed with video production

### Models Downloaded (same session):
- `SadTalker_V0.0.2_256.safetensors` + `_512.safetensors` (725MB each)
- 4x GFPGAN weights (alignment, detection, GFPGANv1.4, parsing) ~737MB total
- All downloaded remotely via SSH from Gaming PC

### SadTalker Test Result (same session):
- **SUCCESS** - First talking head video generated via API
- Output: `C:\ComfyUI\output\20260129185450.mp4` (743KB, ~4.5s, 256x256)
- Required 7 bug fixes across ShowAudio.py, ShowText.py, ShowVideo.py, videoio.py
- Key issues: torchcodec crash, ffmpeg not in service PATH, API vs browser None checks
- Copied ffmpeg.exe to `C:\ComfyUI\` for service access
- Full fix details in `fiverr-assets/VIDEO-PRODUCTION.md`
- **SadTalker status: WORKING**

**Query:** Best tools and methods in 2026 for stitching together short video clips with audio tracks into a final edited video, programmatically on Windows. Need to combine: 1) AI-generated video clips (3-5 seconds each from ComfyUI/Wan2.1), 2) Talking head clips from SadTalker, 3) Screen recordings, 4) Background music and voiceover audio. Looking for Python libraries, FFmpeg commands, or free video editing APIs. Must work locally on Windows with no cloud costs. Compare: moviepy, ffmpeg-python, OpenCV video writing, and any newer 2026 options. Include code examples for common operations like concatenating clips, adding audio tracks, crossfade transitions, and text overlays.

**Response:**
# Best Python Tools for Programmatic Video Stitching on Windows in 2026

**MoviePy is the most recommended option for your use case**, as it handles video concatenation, audio mixing, and effects in pure Python with minimal setup on Windows. However, **FFmpeg-based tools offer superior performance** for production workflows, while **PyAV provides a middle ground** with direct FFmpeg access and better speed than MoviePy.

## [2026-01-30 05:03:22] via perplexity (sonar-pro)

**Query:** Best programmatic video editing solution for use with Claude Code CLI in 2026. I'm using Claude Code (Anthropic's terminal-based AI coding assistant) to build automation scripts on Windows. I need to assemble demo videos from: 1) Short AI-generated clips (3-5s each from ComfyUI Wan2.1), 2) SadTalker talking head clips, 3) Screen recordings, 4) Voiceover audio + background music. Comparing MoviePy vs ffmpeg-python vs PyAV: Which integrates best with a Claude Code workflow where the AI writes and runs Python scripts directly? Consider: installation simplicity (pip install), debugging ease (clear error messages), documentation quality, ability to preview/iterate quickly, and Windows compatibility. Also: is there a way to use FFmpeg directly from Claude Code bash commands for simple operations like concatenation and audio mixing without needing a Python wrapper? Include practical workflow recommendations for someone building videos iteratively with an AI coding assistant.

**Response:**
**FFmpeg directly via subprocess or bash commands in Claude Code integrates best for your 2026 Windows workflow**, offering the simplest installation, fastest performance for concatenation/audio mixing, and easiest debugging/iteration without Python wrappers like MoviePy, ffmpeg-python, or PyAV.[3][5]

### Comparison of Options

**Query:** What are YouTubers and content creators using in January-February 2026 for AI talking head avatar videos and AI image-to-video generation? Compare the most popular tools: SadTalker, Wav2Lip, HeyGen, D-ID, Synthesia, Hedra, Kling AI, Runway Gen-3, Pika Labs, Luma Dream Machine, Hailuo MiniMax, Wan2.1, CogVideoX, and any newer tools. Focus on: 1) Which tools produce the most realistic talking head videos with accurate lip sync? 2) Which free/open-source tools are competitive with paid services? 3) What are the common complaints about SadTalker quality like teeth distortion and jaw artifacts? 4) What newer open-source models have replaced or improved on SadTalker for talking heads? 5) What image-to-video tools give the most realistic motion in 2026? Include specific model names and GitHub repos where applicable.

**Response:**
**HeyGen, Synthesia, D-ID, and emerging tools like Zoice and Higgsfield (with InfiniteTalks and Kling Speak) dominate YouTuber and creator use for realistic AI talking head avatars in early 2026, praised for accurate lip sync and multilingual support.** Image-to-video leaders include Runway Gen-4.5, Pika Labs, and Kling AI for natural motion, with open-source options like CogVideoX trailing paid services in realism.
