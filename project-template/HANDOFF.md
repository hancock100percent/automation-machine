# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Universal Handoff Protocol

**Works with ANY LLM: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.**

---

## IMPORTANT: LLM Role

**YOU ARE ADVISORY ONLY.** You cannot execute commands directly.

Your role:
- Analyze the system state
- Suggest next steps
- Help write code/scripts
- Answer questions about the codebase

The USER must:
- Run all commands manually
- Copy-paste your code suggestions
- Execute scripts themselves
- Report results back to you

---

## Quick Start for ANY LLM

### Step 1: Understand What This Project Does

{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

**Goal:** {{PROJECT_GOAL}}

### Step 2: Read State Files

Ask the user to share contents of:

```
SESSION-LOG.md                            <- What happened last session
knowledge-base/ACTIVE-PROJECTS.md         <- Current status
usage_log.json                            <- Cost tracking
```

### Step 3: Read Active Projects

```
knowledge-base/ACTIVE-PROJECTS.md
```

This tells you:
- Current project status
- What's already done
- What's next in priority order
- Critical constraints

### Step 4: Provide Guidance

Based on the state files, help the user:
- Understand where they left off
- Plan next steps
- Write code if needed
- Debug issues

## Machine Topology

| Machine | IP/Access | Role |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Gaming PC | localhost | Primary dev, local LLMs (Ollama) |
| The Machine | 100.64.130.71 | Server, ComfyUI, heavy compute |
| Laptop | Tailscale | Mobile access |

---

## Rules - Non-Negotiable

### 1. NO Duplication
- Check if tool/script exists before creating new ones

### 2. NO Rebuilding Existing Tools
- Add to existing files, don't recreate them

### 3. NO Over-Engineering
- Ship fast, iterate
- Don't build features not needed yet

### 4. NO Token Waste
- Read small state files first
- Ask clarifying questions before big changes

---

## For Claude Instances

When resuming work, your FIRST message should be:

```
STATE ACKNOWLEDGED:
- Last activity: [date from SESSION-LOG.md]
- Active project: [from ACTIVE-PROJECTS.md]
- Current phase: [from SESSION-LOG.md]

CONFIRMED NEXT ACTION:
- [specific task from ACTIVE-PROJECTS.md]

EXECUTING:
[begin work]
```

---

## For ChatGPT/Gemini/Other LLMs

When the user pastes this handoff, respond with:

```
HANDOFF RECEIVED.

I understand this is the {{PROJECT_NAME}} project.
I am in ADVISORY mode - I cannot execute commands.

To help you, please share:
1. Contents of SESSION-LOG.md
2. Contents of ACTIVE-PROJECTS.md
3. What you're trying to accomplish

I'll analyze and provide guidance.
```
